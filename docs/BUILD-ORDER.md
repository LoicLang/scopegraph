# Build order

## Current state (2026-06-10, end of session)

- Repo bootstrapped: structure, pyproject, CI (ruff + pytest, green), pre-commit.
- Founding docs: `docs/project-kickoff.md` (its §4 schema superseded), MVP design spec
  `docs/specs/2026-06-09-scopegraph-mvp-design.md`, fine-grain schema spec
  `docs/specs/2026-06-10-graph-schema-fine-grain-design.md`.
- **W1 foundations DONE** (branch `w1-foundations`, executed via subagent-driven-development
  from `docs/plans/2026-06-10-week1-foundations.md`):
  - ADR 0000 (pivot) + ADR 0001 (schema v1 frozen: 7 node types, 7 edge types, topology
    matrix, domains as ecosystem data).
  - `core/graph/`: Pydantic models + TOPOLOGY, fail-fast loader (vocabulary, topology,
    PART_OF cardinality, cancelled-project rules), GraphService (`get_node`, `neighbors`,
    `k_hop` with path provenance). 37 hermetic tests, ruff clean.
  - Seed: 72 fictional French banking-IT nodes (9 systems, 24 features, 6 business objects,
    7 projects, 8 decisions, 12 constraints, 6 risks), 100 edges, 7 deliberate traps — each
    trap has an integration test in `tests/test_seed.py`.
  - README v1 · 6 eval cases drafted in `docs/eval/cases.md`.
- **Graph viewer** (2026-06-10): `./scripts/graph-viz` generates an interactive standalone
  Cytoscape view of the graph (filters, search incl. aliases, highlight mode). Built on
  `core/viz/payload.py` — the data seam the W2 web Context Map pane and the W4 scoping
  highlight will reuse. Spec: `docs/specs/2026-06-10-graph-viz-design.md` (amends the MVP
  spec: Context Map medium = interactive viewer; Mermaid deferred to the dossier export).

## Next chantier — Week 2 (retrieval + first web screens)

**W2 design spec validated** (2026-06-10 brainstorm):
`docs/specs/2026-06-10-week2-retrieval-mapping-web-design.md` — the build contract for the
four lots (embeddings+Chroma, hybrid scorer, deterministic MAPPING loop with template
questions, FastAPI+Alpine first screens). Key decisions: no LLM/agent in the loop (template
questions in W2, LLM rephrases in W3), query = accumulated ProjectBrief, pivot trigger
derived from domains (no schema change), map payload rides the message response.

**Next step: write the implementation plan** (`docs/plans/`, writing-plans) from that spec,
then execute subagent-driven on branch `w2-retrieval-web`, TDD — same mechanics as W1.

## Later

W3 LLM providers (Mistral/DeepSeek/Mock) + grounding gate + challenge · W4 dossier +
Context Map polish + write-back + scripted demo + eval run. See MVP spec §8.

W4 note (decided in session, 2026-06-10): write-back needs a small TOPOLOGY-extension ADR —
allow `Project → DEPENDS_ON → System` and `Project → OPERATES_ON → BusinessObject` so an
in-flight project can express what it touches (collision detection). New `Feature` nodes are
NOT created at scoping write-back (intention ≠ reality); they enter the graph at delivery,
via `PRODUCED` (see fine-grain spec §6).
